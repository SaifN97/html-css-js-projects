              <strong>1964</strong> - born in Beirut, Lebanon, on September 2.
              <p class="info-text">
                Keanu Charles Reeves (/kiˈɑːnuː/ kee-AH-noo;[4][5][6] born
                September 2, 1964) is a Canadian[b] actor. Born in Beirut and
                raised in Toronto, Reeves began acting in theatre productions
                and in television films before making his feature film debut in
                Youngblood (1986). He had his breakthrough role in the science
                fiction comedy Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), and he
                later reprised his role in its sequels. He gained praise for
                playing a hustler in the independent drama My Own Private Idaho
                (1991), and established himself as an action hero with leading
                roles in Point Break (1991) and Speed (1994).

              <strong>1984–1990</strong> - Early work
              <p class="info-text">
                In 1984, Reeves was a correspondent for the Canadian
                Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) youth television program Going
                Great.[23] That same year, he made his acting debut in an
                episode of the television series, called Hangin' In.[24] In
                1985, he played Mercutio in a stage production of Romeo and
                Juliet at the Leah Posluns Theatre in North York,
                Ontario.[25][26] He made further appearances on stage, including
                Brad Fraser's cult hit Wolfboy in Toronto. He also appeared in a
                Coca-Cola commercial, and in 1985, the National Film Board of
                Canada (NFB) coming-of-age, short film One Step Away.[27]

              <strong>1991–1994</strong> - Breakthrough with adult roles
              <p class="info-text">
                In 1991, Reeves starred in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, a sequel
                to Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, with his co-star Alex
                Winter. Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that
                the sequel was "more imaginative, more opulent, wilder and
                freer, more excitingly visualized", praising the actors for
                their "fuller" performances.[35] Film critic Roger Ebert thought
                it was "a riot of visual invention and weird humor that works on
                its chosen sub-moronic level [...] It's the kind of movie where
                you start out snickering in spite of yourself, and end up
                actually admiring the originality that went into creating this
                hallucinatory slapstick".[36] The rest of 1991 marked a
                significant transition for Reeves' career as he undertook adult
                roles. Co-starring with River Phoenix as a street hustler in the
                adventure My Own Private Idaho, the characters embark on a
                journey of personal discovery. The story was written by Gus Van
                Sant, and is loosely based on Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1,
                Henry IV, Part 2, and Henry V. The film premiered at the 48th
                Venice International Film Festival,[37] followed by a theatrical
                release in the United States on September 29, 1991.

              <strong>1995–1998</strong> - Continued acting efforts
              <p class="info-text">
                Following Speed, Reeves' next leading role came in 1995, in the
                cyberpunk action thriller Johnny Mnemonic. It is based on the
                story of the same title by William Gibson, about a man who has
                had a cybernetic brain implant. As part of the film studio's
                marketing efforts, a CD-ROM video game was also released.[64]
                The film received mainly negative reviews and critics felt
                Reeves was "woefully miscast".[65] He next appeared in the
                romantic drama A Walk in the Clouds (1995), which also garnered
                mixed-to-negative reviews.

              <strong>1999–2004</strong> - Stardom with The Matrix franchise and
              comedies
              <p class="info-text">
                In 1999, Reeves starred in the critically acclaimed science
                fiction film The Matrix, the first instalment in what would
                become The Matrix franchise.[80] Reeves portrays computer
                programmer Thomas Anderson, a hacker using the alias "Neo", who
                discovers humanity is trapped inside a simulated reality created
                by intelligent machines. Written and directed by the Wachowskis,
                Reeves had to prepare by reading Kevin Kelly's Out of Control:
                The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic
                World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology.

              <strong>2005–2013</strong> - Thrillers, documentaries and
              directorial debut
              <p class="info-text">
                In 2005, Reeves played the titular role in Constantine, an
                occult detective film, about a man who has the ability to
                perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons. The
                film was a respectable box office hit, grossing $230 million
                worldwide from a $100 million budget but attracted
                mixed-to-positive reviews.[106] The Sydney Morning Herald's
                critic wrote that "Constantine isn't bad, but it doesn't deserve
                any imposing adjectives. It's occasionally cheesy, sometimes
                enjoyable, intermittently scary, and constantly spiked with
                celestial blatherskite".

              <strong>2014–present</strong> - Resurgence with John Wick
              <p class="info-text">
                After this series of commercial failures, Reeves career
                rebounded in 2014. He played the titular role in the action
                thriller John Wick, directed by Chad Stahelski. In the first
                instalment of the John Wick franchise, Reeves plays a retired
                hitman seeking vengeance. He worked closely with the
                screenwriter to develop the story; "We all agreed on the
                potential of the project. I love the role, but you want the
                whole story, the whole ensemble to come to life", Reeves
                said.[140] Filmed on location in the New York City area, the
                film was eventually released on October 24 in the United States.
